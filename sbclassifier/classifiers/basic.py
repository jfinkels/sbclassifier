"""An implementation of a Bayes-like spam classifier.

Paul Graham's original description:

    http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html

A highly fiddled version of that can be retrieved from our CVS repository,
via tag Last-Graham.  This made many demonstrated improvements in error
rates over Paul's original description.

This code implements Gary Robinson's suggestions, the core of which are
well explained on his webpage:

   http://radio.weblogs.com/0101454/stories/2002/09/16/spamDetection.html

This is theoretically cleaner, and in testing has performed at least as
well as our highly tuned Graham scheme did, often slightly better, and
sometimes much better.  It also has "a middle ground", which people like:
the scores under Paul's scheme were almost always very near 0 or very near
1, whether or not the classification was correct.  The false positives
and false negatives under Gary's basic scheme (use_gary_combining) generally
score in a narrow range around the corpus's best spam_cutoff value.
However, it doesn't appear possible to guess the best spam_cutoff value in
advance, and it's touchy.

The last version of the Gary-combining scheme can be retrieved from our
CVS repository via tag Last-Gary.

The chi-combining scheme used by default here gets closer to the theoretical
basis of Gary's combining scheme, and does give extreme scores, but also
has a very useful middle ground (small # of msgs spread across a large range
of scores, and good cutoff values aren't touchy).

This implementation is due to Tim Peters et alia.
